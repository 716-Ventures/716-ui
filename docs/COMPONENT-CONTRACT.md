# Component parity contract

Every implemented component needs a completed contract and a gallery scenario for each supported state. This is a specification template, not evidence of implemented behavior.

## Reference provenance

Record the upstream repository and exact commit, component source paths, style/theme, underlying primitive and version, fonts/icons and licenses, motion definitions and reference environment. Record display scale and text rendering settings for comparisons. Reference selection is pending; no component is currently declared conformant.

## Required component specification

| Section | Required information |
|---|---|
| API | Name/version, typed props, defaults, variants, slots and emitted events |
| Appearance | Dimensions, spacing, type metrics, colors, border, radius, shadow and icon geometry |
| States | Default, hover, pressed, focus, selection, disabled, loading and error, where applicable |
| Input | Keyboard map, pointer actions, text/IME handling, clipboard and touch if supported |
| Focus | Entry target, traversal, roving focus where appropriate, modal containment and restoration |
| Overlays | Anchor geometry, clipping avoidance, collision handling, outside interaction and dismissal |
| Motion | Trigger, property, duration, easing, delay, transform origin and interruption behavior |
| Accessibility | Role, name, value, state, relationships, announcements and actions |
| Adaptation | Light/dark themes, text scaling, display scale, RTL, localization and reduced motion |
| Data | Controlled/uncontrolled behavior, stable identity, draft handling and validation |
| Limits | Large/empty content, resource limits, failure states and degraded behavior |

Preserve upstream behavior where defined. If a required case is unspecified, record the library's deliberate extension; do not invent an upstream guarantee. For each motion, specify what happens when reversed or interrupted before completion. Reduced motion must retain immediate, understandable state feedback.

## Verification

Maintain reference scenarios for all supported variants and states, with native captures at matching sizes, fonts and scale. Compare geometry, colors and typography with documented tolerances; differences from font rasterization require explicit assessment rather than a blanket pixel-perfect claim.

Run the same interaction sequences against the reference and native implementation: pointer, keyboard, focus restoration, selection, dismissal and editing. Compare outcomes and accessibility semantics rather than browser-specific implementation details. Capture motion over time to compare duration, easing and continuity, not just endpoint screenshots.

The native gallery must exercise these cases without an agent or external account. Mark unimplemented, partial and verified coverage honestly. A component is not complete merely because its default screenshot matches.
